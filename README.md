# Technology review

## Building the paper

Navigate to within the `paper/` paper directory, and run `sh build-elsevier.sh` at the command line. This will generate `paper.pdf` from  `paper.Rmd`.

## Content

This repository contains material for the model development component of the PhD, and will include:

- [To be added]: Notes on the work carried out
- `paper/`: Paper source (for publication and thesis chapter content)

## Project outputs

- Paper for publication, with completed findings
- Thesis chapter (largely based on the paper)
- An open source tool for the benchmarking case study

## TODO

- Go back to the Tat case study
	- Apply simple spatial discretisation
	- Apply simple temporal discretisation
	- Compare the two linear formulations and the nonlinear formulations
	- Compare the hierarchical time discretisation with the peak/average time share
- Write paper
- Write chapter thesis
